# Photometric-Approach-to-Surface-Reconstruction-of-Artist-Paintings

This project is aimed to present a final product that can be named as “digital reproduction of oil paintings” which includes perceptual attributes of artworks such as color, topography, gloss and enables viewers to observe this realistic 3D model interactively from different vantage points and under various illumination conditions.
